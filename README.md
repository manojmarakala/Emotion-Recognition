 Proposed Solution

 The proposed solution uses Python with OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras to build a deep learning model for emotion detection. The process begins by collecting facial expression datasets such as FER-2013, CK+, or JAFFE. Images are pre-processed (resized, normalized, and augmented) to improve model robustness. A CNN or transfer learning model is trained to classify emotions into predefined categories. Real-time emotion detection is achieved by integrating OpenCV for face detection and feeding cropped faces to the trained network. The model outputs an emotion label, which is displayed on the screen with bounding boxes. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1 score are used to validate performance.

 Expected Outcome 

The system will successfully identify human emotions from facial expressions in static images or live webcam feeds. Each detected face will display an emotion label in real time. The model will achieve high accuracy across different datasets and lighting conditions. This project demonstrates the potential of AI in emotional intelligence,enhancing interaction between humans and machines through adaptive and responsive systems.
